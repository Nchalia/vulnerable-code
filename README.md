****** **Steps to be fix**:******

1. Update Node.js base image to a current LTS version like 18-alpine or 20-alpine as Node.js 14 is outdated or  maybe even unsupported now

2. Remove --unsafe-perm from npm install in Dockerfile because it runs npm with root privileges, which isn't secure

3. For the above issue add a non-root user in the Dockerfile to avoid running as root.

4. Dockerfile copies package*.json but doesn't include a package-lock.json. Without a lock file, npm install might get newer versions with vulnerabilities.

4. Use npm ci instead of npm install in Dockerfile for production builds to respect the package-lock.json.

5. Generate a package-lock.json by running npm install locally and commit it, then copy it into the Docker image.

6. Run npm audit to check for vulnerabilities in dependencies.If there are issues, update the packages (like Express if needed) and regenerate the lock file.

7. Update the app.listen in index.js to use '0.0.0.0' so the app is accessible in the Docker container.

8. Set up automated security scanning in the repo using GitHub Actions with Dependabot or Snyk to automatically detect and fix future vulnerabilities.
